        <h3>Leetcode 291. Word Pattern II</h3>
        <h4>Posted on Oct 05, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p> This question is much harder than 290. Word Pattern despite the only difference it removes the space between words. What makes it hard is that now we don't know where does one word, where does one end. In this kind of scenario, one should use backtracking. I used set for the same reason as previous question. The beginning of 
    helper function is what I called "ending conditions" and recursion logic is buried in the foor loop (there are two separate cases for each potential word: either in hashtable or not). One should deal with those two cases
    separately.
</p>

<pre><code> 
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordPatternMatch(string pattern, string str) {
        unordered_map&lt;char, string> m;
        set&lt;string> s;
        return helper(pattern, 0, str, 0, m, s);
    }
    
    bool helper(string& pattern, int p1, string& str, int p2, unordered_map&lt;char, string>& m, set&lt;string>& s) {
        if (p1 == pattern.size() && p2 == str.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        if (p1 == pattern.size() || p2 == str.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        char c = pattern[p1];
        for (int i = p2; i < str.size(); ++i) {
            string word = str.substr(p2, i - p2 + 1);
            if (m.find(c) != m.end()) {
                if (m[c] == word) {
                    return helper(pattern, p1 + 1, str, i + 1, m, s);
                }

        <h3>Leetcode 362. Design Hit Counter</h3>
        <h4>Posted on Oct 05, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p> I think the main difficult lies in the follow-up questions: <b>What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?</b>
</p>
<p> I think in a real interview, that is the kind of questions you should bring it up to the interview before you are asked. It is quite likely that there are thousands if not millions of hits each second. One may wish to use long or long long instead of int below to avoid overflow issues. since $2^32 - 1 = 4,294,967,295$, it is not that a large number. Overflow could happen when we don't have 300 seconds but a lot more granularities. maybe 300 * 60 ms. Also try not use 300 directly in the codes, define a constant number instead. The algorithm side, using a bucket of 300 is quick smart, definitely smarter than using a queue and returning the size of queue as the result. Since the size of queue could be very large and that is simply a waste of memory when you don't need to store the exact timestamp (same here) many many times. It could easily lead to memory issues when scaling up. Therefore, one should never do that in practice. Instead the requirement says that you need to keep the history, then you should write it to a database/disk for every second query results. I think more likely case is that not only hits are useful but also the hit comes with other useful information and those information usually is written to database. One may wish to access those later. (a need to record the hits id within past 300 seconds). One just need to add a vector&lt;vector&lt;int>> to store those.</p>

<pre><code> 
class HitCounter {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    HitCounter() {
        times.resize(300, 0);
        hits.resize(300, 0);
    }
    
    /** Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    void hit(int timestamp) {
        int idx = timestamp % 300;
        if (times[idx] == timestamp) {
            hits[idx]++;
        } else {
            times[idx] = timestamp;
            hits[idx] = 1;
        }
        return;
    }
    
    /** Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    int getHits(int timestamp) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_BUCKETS; ++i) {
            // the line below is not needed of there are hits every second
            if (timestamp - times[i] < 300) {
                res += hits[i];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
private:
    int NUM_BUCKETS = 300;
    // record timestamp for past 300 seconds
    vector&lt;int> times;
    // record how many hits for past 300 seconds
    vector&lt;int> hits;
    
};

/**
 * Your HitCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * HitCounter obj = new HitCounter();
 * obj.hit(timestamp);
 * int param_2 = obj.getHits(timestamp);

        <h3>Leetcode 609. Find Duplicate File in System</h3>
        <h4>Posted on Oct 05, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p>Use of Hashmap. I feel whenever one is dealing with string, it is much easier to do so using Python. 
Here, we don't have to use dfs or bfs, since the paths have been given. Those follow up questions are quite
interesting: 
<ul id="black">
  <li>1. Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?</li>
  <li>2. If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?</li>
  <li>3. If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?</li>
  <li>4. What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?</li>
  <li>5. How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?</li>
</ul>  
My understandings are:
<ul id="black">
  <li>1. In real life, one may want to use dfs over bfs when the search is deep, since bfs uses much more memory than
dfs. BFS may have better cache performance, due to locality of files on disk. But if you know the files you are searching for is close to the node you are currently at, then BFS may be performing better. </li>  
<li> 2. It is not possible to hash the entire contents as what the codes did below. Instead, one should
first map files accoring to file size, for the files of same size, hash a small part of file using MD5 for example.
Only when all those are the same, we will compare byte by byte.</li>
<li> 3. We can still hash 1k chunk similarly.</li>
<li>4. Worst time complexity is $O(n^2 * k)$, when all files have the same size k bytes, and we have to compare every two files byte by byte.</li>
<li>5. file size, hash, byte by byte as last sanity check.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<pre><code> 
class Solution {
public:
    vector&lt;vector&lt;string>> findDuplicate(vector&lt;string>& paths) {

            getline(ss, root, ' ');
            while (getline(ss, s, ' ')) {
                string filename = root + '/' + s.substr(0, s.find('('));

		<h3>Leetcode 479. Largest Palindrome Product</h3>
		<h4>Posted on Sep 17, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p> makePalindrome() function to create a palindrome number in 
	a traditional way without using string. Moreover, it supports to create palindrome 
of odd length and of even length. With left part of palindrome number (including middle digit
for odd length) equals to seed $x$. In pratice, what I found is that it always returns 
in the first for loop in largestPalindrome(), not sure why....maybe the existence can be proved. 
Also, for even $n$, we can further find the trick of generating the palindrome number by
performing when $n = 2$, $(10^2+1)*(10^2-1)-(10^1*(10^2-1)) = 9009$ and when $n = 6$, get $(10^6+1)*(10^6-1)-(10^3*(10^6-1))
= 999000000999$， instead of largest candidate $9999$ and $999999999999$. So for even number, we
can get the results easily. Also, here $n$ cannot be too large, otherwise, there will be overflow
issues for long (32 bits).

		<h3>Leetcode 657. Judge Route Circle</h3>
		<h4>Posted on Sep 17, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p>It seems the question already assumes each character has to be one of 'R', 'L', 
	'U', 'D' and using unordered_map is slowerer than using 4 variables due to the overhead.
One can simply use 4 variables each corresponding to one of the moves and check the
same criteria. Well, in that case,
one can even use two variables just representing the difference of each pair of moves. One variable
does not work all the time, since decoding $R = 2, L = -2, U = 3, D = -3$, then $3 * R + 2 * D = 0$,
although they should not be so. It only works if lowest common multiple: 
$x * R = y * U$ and $x > n, y > n$, where n is
the length of string. Only satisfying this criteria, one can use one global variable.</p>

		<h3>Leetcode 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL</h3>
		<h4>Posted on Sep 10, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p>Basically we want to use $62^6 = 56,800,235,584$ to represent all the URLs for
	all the websites (1.6 billion as of 2016 so 6 digits are sufficient). To achieve this, first idea is to design a hashing function. One can use the codes below to avoid conflicts but it will be slow eventually,
	because towards the end, it will be harder and harder to find approporiate shorturl.
	Similar idea, one can use md5/sha1 which takes "longurl + timestamp" as key and regenerate
	hash codes when there are conflicts. Of course, when data gets very large and exceed memory 
	size of one machine, one should use distributed SQL or NoSQL database to store key-value pair.
	(also depending on the peak QPS: Queries Per Second).
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/hgl868/article/details/7057843">here</a> for more details on the
use of rand(), and srand() to generate pseudo-random number.</p>

<h3>Leetcode 534. Design TinyURL</h3>
<p>The second way is to create a one-to-one mapping between base10 and base62. One can simply use base10/base62 as primary keys and longURL as values in SQL databases. 
	We can increment the counter by 1 when a new
link is added. When we want to add links distributedly, we can assign counter quota in advance to each machine (creating mapping in advance but leave value field empty) and then fill them out. For 
more details on System Design, see this <a href="https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/95853/a-complete-solution-for-tinyurl-leetcode-system-design/2">post</a>. In this kind of question,
one should first be clear about the purpose (e.g. indexing pages in advance or on the fly) 
by asking. Then one should figure out how many users, work load, QPS, read-write speed (read
heavy or write heavy), and figure out
which database to use (SQL vs NoSQL, row vs column, single machine vs distributed DB). 
And design system algorithms (e.g. here is URLService class, including encode and decode API).
One can further optimize using DB sharding (not only horizontal partitioning but
also data replication) and cache server.</p>

		<h3>Leetcode 23. Merge k Sorted Lists</h3>
		<h4>Posted on Sep 8, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p>Pay attention to the syntax that lambda expression cannot be used inside
	priority_queue template and one should use <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functors-in-cpp/">functor</a>. This is different from <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort">sort</a>. For sorting, there are a few different ways of changing
	 default comparator, either by overloading operators or using lambda expression/functor to create
	 custom operator (in C++, default is std:less, and default is max heap for priority 
	 queue, sorting order is increasing by fault). One can use functor for sort too but one should
	 use cmp() instead of cmp. </p>
	 <p>Advantage of C++ over Python in interview is that one can easily use min-heap by <pre><code>priority_queue&lt;int, vector&lt;int&gt;, greater&lt;int&gt;&gt; Q; </code></pre></p>
	 <p>For the question itself, there are two ways of solving this question. One is divide and 
	 	conquer: merge 2 lists at one time, and do it from bottom-up approach. The other is use
	 	extra space to store first node for each linked-list. Both approaches have the same time complexity: $O(n \ k \ log(k))$, where $n$ is average number of nodes in a list and $k$
	 	is number of lists.</p>
	 <p>Also pay attention to the difference of heap and priority_queue: see <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vernon/cs367/notes/11.PRIORITY-Q.html">here</a>. The one usually referred is called 
	 	Binary Heap but there are many more variants of heaps and see this notes for time 
	 	complexity comparisons <a href="http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~ananth/CptS223/Lectures/heaps.pdf">link</a>.</p>

		<h3>Leetcode 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II</h3>
		<h4>Posted on Sep 8, 2017</h4>
<br>
<p>The main difference this question and previous question is that this may contain duplicates. 
Therefore, one should consider cases when duplicate affect the decision whether left or right
subsequence is increasing. Consider $[3, 1, 1]$ and $[1, 1, 3, 1]$, one can see that
it is impossible to tell when $nums[mid] = nums[right]$, but we do know that nums[right] is not
the target we want, therefore, we can simply by removing the right-most element and
trim into a smaller subsequence which has a deterministic relationship between
nums[mid] and nums[right] without affecting the final answer. If every element is exactly the
same, then we have $O(n)$ time complexity instead of $O(log(n))$ and this is the best we can do.</p>

<p>if value at mid is less than value at right, then it means the
 right subsequence is increasing and we want to check if target 
 is in this subsequence or not. If not, we go to left hand side.
If value at mid is greater than the value at right, that means
we have the left subsequence increasing. We should have different
rules of checking if target value falls left or right hand side
 for those two scenarios. </p>

		<h3>Leetcode 277. Find the Celebrity</h3>
		<h4>Posted on Sep 4, 2017</h4>
<p>Just decided to restart doing the leetcodes starting from facebook/Google tag....</p>
<p>This solution is very brilliant: all the other solutions in terms of number of API calls are
$O(n^2)$ but this solution is $O(n)$. Moreover, the space complexity is also $O(1)$. One should
image this problem as the following abstraction problems: you are given a matrix of unknown values,
which can only be $1$ or $-1$. If $X_{ij} = 1$ means Person $i$ knows Person $j$, $-1$ means otherwise. It costs a lot to flip to find out what the value is. Can you flip least to find the $i$-th diagonal element such that all the elements in that row is $-1$ while all the elements in the column is $1$? (Obviously you don't care what $X_{ii}$ is). Naively, if we go through the matrix one by one, and store everything, we have $O(n^2)$ for both time and space complexity. A slightly smarter way is to use an array to store bool values and eliminate certain rows and columns when doing the check for one potential candidate. (refer to codes in the first solution). 
But this is still quadratic. The second solution is linear, since the number of API is at most $2n$.
One can think of this a shortest path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, i)$, with $i$ unknown and to be
determined. And the constraint of the path is that the horizontal path has to be consisting of
all $-1$'s and when having no choice, it has to take diagonal path. This way, the path is 
contained in the upper diagonal matrix and that is why doing the final check, one
shouldn't double check the path that has been checked already. If the final res is $i$, that means all values before $i$ cannot be answer because it was changed to $i$ when it has no choice (knows someone) and all values after $i$ also does not work because $i$ does not know the value after $i$ (so cannot be celebrity).</p>

		# good habit, despite python doesn't have overflow issue like c++ and java
		mid = left + (right - left) / 2 
		if nums[mid] == target:
			return mid
		elif nums[mid] < target:
			left = mid + 1
		else:
			right = mid
	return -1

def binarySearch(nums, target):
	left = 0
	right = len(nums) - 1
	while left <= right:
		# good habit, despite python doesn't have overflow issue like c++ and java
		mid = left + (right - left) / 2 
		if nums[mid] == target:
			return mid
		elif nums[mid] < target:
			left = mid + 1
		else:
			right = mid - 1
	print(left,right)
	return -1
</code></pre>  

<p>By moving 1 into while loop, one can actually write as below. Then, question comes: <b>what has this exactly achieved?</b></p>  
<p> The answer is that this way, 
	left and right are all in bound of the array. If not putting 1 in the while loop, either left or right will cause the so-called "out of bound" error if one writes <i>nums[left]</i>  or <i>nums[right]</i>. If you don't believe, you can check the printed left and right value by running the python codes.</p>
<pre><code class="python"> 
def binarySearch(nums, target):
	left = 0
	right = len(nums) - 1
	while left + 1 < right:
		# good habit, despite python doesn't have overflow issue like c++ and java
		mid = left + (right - left) / 2 
		if nums[mid] == target:
			return mid
		elif nums[mid] < target:
			left = mid 
		else:
			right = mid 
	print(left,right)
	return -1
</code></pre>  
<p>As one may wonder, why is this "in-bound" property useful in practice? It is not particularly useful for finding exact match but it is very very useful for finding lowerbound or upperbound of array. For $[1,6,6,6,8,10]$, I want to find the largest index of element out of those which are smaller than or equal to the target value. To achieve this, I can simply modify my code to be the following: </p>
<pre><code class="python"> 
def binarySearch(nums, target):
	left = 0
	right = len(nums) - 1
	while left + 1 < right:
		# good habit, despite python doesn't have overflow issue like c++ and java
		mid = left + (right - left) / 2 
		if nums[mid] >= target:
			right = mid
		else:
			left = mid 
	print(left,right)
	# to find the smallest index among all the equal numbers, like 6 in the example
	if nums[right] <= target:
		return right
	else:
		return left
</code></pre>
<p>If one wants to find the largest index of element out of all which are smaller than the target,
we should tweak the codes a little bit: just need to change last 4 lines of code to be more precise</p> 		
<pre><code class="python"> 
def binarySearch(nums, target):
	left = 0
	right = len(nums) - 1
	while left + 1 < right:
		# good habit, despite python doesn't have overflow issue like c++ and java
		mid = left + (right - left) / 2 
		if nums[mid] >= target:
			right = mid
		else:
			left = mid 
	print(left,right)
	# to find the largest index of element out of all which are smaller than the target,
	if nums[right] < target:
		return right
	else:
		return left 
</code></pre>	
<h4>Do you feel this way it is much easier to memorize Binary Search Codes? </h4>
<p>Similarly, to find the smallest index of element out of those which are larger than or equal to the target value, we should do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="python"> 
def binarySearch(nums, target):
	left = 0
	right = len(nums) - 1
	while left + 1 < right:
		# good habit, despite python doesn't have overflow issue like c++ and java
		mid = left + (right - left) / 2 
		if nums[mid] > target:
			right = mid
		else:
			left = mid 
	print(left,right)
	if nums[left] >= target:
		return left
	else:
		return right

				My first idea is to use dfs to search all possible subsets of sum of half of the toal, however, it does not pass the large cases of leetcode. I even tried to sort the input array but still no luck. See my code:

            self.res = True
        if total > target or position >= len(nums):
            return

			<p> Then I search solutions online and then realize that this question should be solved using DP (Dynamic Programming). Well, it is not surprising now when you think back, right? Just recall how many times that dp beats recursion in previous questions. But I haven't really coded in python for a long time and haven't done leetcode for a long time too. So it is really a good idea to summarize as I do now. I wish I can keep this habit just like what I did for running. So the dp code is below:</p>	
<pre><code align="left" class = "code">
class Solution(object):
    def canPartition(self, nums):
        if sum(nums) % 2 == 0:
            target = sum(nums) / 2
        else:
            return False
        nums.sort()
        total = sum(nums) 
        dp = [False for i in range(target + 1)]
        dp[0] = True
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in reversed(range(nums[i], target + 1)):
                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - nums[i]]
        return dp[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>If you find the code above hard to understand, don't blame yourself. Because it is pretty hard to understand. It is actually a version after space optimization. Time complexity here is $O(n^2)$ and space is $O(n)$. The more straight forward one before optimization will be following and the recurrence equation is </p>
<pre><code class = "cpp">
bool canPartition(vector&lt;int&gt;& nums) {
    int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);

    }
    int target = sum / 2;
    int n = nums.size();
    vector&lt;vector&lt;bool&gt;&gt; dp(n + 1, vector&lt;bool&gt;(target + 1, false));
    //now we have to initialize the dp array
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){
        dp[i][0] = true;
    }
    for(int j = 0; j <= target; ++j){
        dp[0][j] = false;
    }
    dp[0][0] = true;
    // recurrence equation is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j - nums[i-1]] if j >= nums[i - 1]
    // dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] otherwise
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){

</code></pre>
<p>To summarize, the recursion approach is a top-down approach: Start solving the given problem by breaking it down. If you see that the problem has been solved already, then just return the saved answer. If it has not been solved, solve it and save the answer. This is usually easy to think of and very intuitive. This is also referred to as Memoization. While Dynamic Programming approach is a bottom-up approach: Analyze the problem and see the order in which the sub-problems are solved and start solving from the trivial subproblem, up towards the given problem. In this process, it is guaranteed that the subproblems are solved before solving the problem. Read more from the <a href="./materials/dpnotes.pdf">notes</a> by professor at UIUC.</p>

			<h3>Leetcode 617. Merge Two Binary Trees</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 21, 2017</h4>
			<p>
			I have the feeling that most questions regarding trees require to use either recursion or stack (queue) to do it iteratively. </p>
			
			<p>And most questions are based on four traversal of trees, namely level order, preorder, postorder, and inorder traversal (Or using similar ideas). </p>

			<p>So let us review how we do level order first: the basic idea is that using the queue to store root node first and then each time enqueue its left child node and right child node of the node dequeuing the queue. This way, the nodes in the same level of the tree will always be stored in a block fashion in the queue. </p>
<pre><code>
class Solution(object):
    def levelOrder(self, root):
	    if not root: return []
	    q = collections.deque()
	    q.append(root)
	    res = []
	    while q:
	        level = []
	        for i in range(len(q)):
	            p = q.popleft()
	            if p.left: q.append(p.left)
	            if p.right: q.append(p.right)    
	            level.append(p.val)    
	        res.append(level)
	    return res
									
</code></pre>

			<p>To do preorder traversal, using queue does not work, because preoder has to finsh all the left subtree of root before going to the right subtree. So here, only using stack can achieve that. </p>
			

<pre><code>
class Solution(object):
    def preorderTraversal(self, root):
    	if not root:
    		return []
    	res = []
    	stack = [root]
    	while stack:
    		p = stack.pop()
    		res.append(p.val)
    		if p.right:
    			stack.append(p.right)
    		if p.left:
    			stack.append(p.left)
    	return res


</code></pre>

			<p>Or recursively:</p>
<pre><code>
class Solution(object):
    def preorderTraversal(self, root):
    	if not root:
    		return []
    	left_subtree = self.preorderTraversal(root.left)
    	right_subtree = self.preorderTraversal(root.right)
    	return [root.val] + left_subtree + right_subtree

</code></pre>

			<p>As one can see, when you use stack, one can easily transform into recrusion, which uses call stack while when you need to use queue, such as BFS not DFS then it is much more diffciult, or/and not optimal to transform into recursion. A lot of people have discussed on this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2549541/performing-breadth-first-search-recursively/2549825#2549825">link</a> For level traversal, one can see code: <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-tree-traversal/">link</a>, which is $O(n^2)$ when the tree is skewed.</p>

			<p>To do inorder traversal, similar reasoning compels us to use stack. See code below:</p>

			<pre><code>
class Solution(object):
    def inorderTraversal(self, root):
    	if not root:
    		return []
    	res = []
    	stack = []
    	p = root
    	while stack or p:
    		while p:
    			stack.append(p)
    			p = p.left
    		node = stack.pop()
    		p = node.right
    		res.append(node.val)
    	return res
			</code></pre>

			<p>One can see that the main difference is the order of pushing nodes onto stack. Instead of the order "parent, right child, left child", one has to push in the order of "root, left child of root, left child of previous one, ...., left-most child in tree, its right-brother (since left-most child's parent already in tree and by this time it has been poped out)"</p>

			<p>Postorder is probably the most difficult among these four, of course here I mean iterative writing. See code:</p>
			
			<pre><code>
class Solution(object):
	def postorderTraversal(self, root):
		if not root:
			return []
		res = []
		stack = []
		p = root
		prev = None
		while stack or p:
			while p:
				stack.append(p)
				p = p.left
			node = stack[-1]
			if node.right == None or prev == node.right:
				stack.pop()
				res.append(node.val)
				prev = node
			else:
				p = node.right
		return res

			</code></pre>

			<p>By the way, if you are like me, who totally forgot tree terminology, then you should check the difference between depth, level, and height. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2603692/what-is-the-difference-between-tree-depth-and-height">link</a>. Another example of how important tree is in applications, is that when I tried to parse nested JSON data at work today, I suddenly realize that one can do DFS (together with Python json library) to search for keywords in nestes JSON data format.</p>
			

			<p>
			Okay, let us do the easy Leetcode Question <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/#/description">619</a> together:
 			</p>

class Solution(object):
    def mergeTrees(self, t1, t2):
        """
        :type t1: TreeNode
        :type t2: TreeNode

        if t1 == None and t2 == None:

            return t1
        else:
            left_subtree = self.mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left)
            right_subtree = self.mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right)
            total = t1.val + t2.val
            root = TreeNode(total)
            root.left = left_subtree

 			<p>I was thinking of doing it iteratively but then I realize it is much easier to do it recursively. To do the problem iteratively, one probably has to use two queues for BFS (or stacks for DFS) rather than one call stack.

			<h3>Leetcode 458. Poor Pigs</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 18, 2017</h4>
			<p><a href="https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/67666/another-explanation-and-solution">Someone's idea</a> is so brilliant. I suspect he studies math before. To do this question, one has to understand how many buckets (or bucket groups) one pig can check within the test time. If using one pig, that is test_time / die_time + 1, but when using two or more pigs, it shouldn't be number_pigs * (test_time / die_time + 1).....which is my naive idea and it is too small. Instead it should be (test_time / die_time + 1)^number_pigs. The reason is one can arrange all the buckets in R^n space. Each coordinate axis should be indexed from 0 to (test_time / die_time + 1) and in total there are number_pigs coordinates. This way each pig helps to reduce the space from R^n to R^(n-1) by determing a particular bucket group in that particular coordinate axis, since there is only one poison in buckets. Therefore, one should have n = log(number_buckets)/log(test_time / die_time + 1) and rounding up. One can code using while loop or using log from math library in Python or any other language.

def poorPigs(self, buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest):
    pigs = 0
    while (minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1) ** pigs < buckets:

			<p>This <a href="https://medium.com/@jeeyoungk/how-sharding-works-b4dec46b3f6">article</a> gives great introduction on database sharding. Sharding has horizontal and vertical two ways. Vertical means split tables into serveral tables but this is difficult and

"Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is resized, only $K/n$ keys need to be remapped on average, where $K$ is the number of keys, and $n$ is the number of slots", accoring to wikipedia. It is used to ensure scalability and availability for

			<h3>Kubernetes for Container Orchestration</h3>

			<p> Recently at the company, I listened to a few talks, one is on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/">k8s</a> and one is on product by mesosphere. Well, it seems that sales engineer at mesosphere are not even that familiar with their own products...although the concepts of what they are doing is interesting: how to scheule containers optimally on the clouds (called DC-OS), I feel it is hard for this start-up to go IPO. Maybe time would prove me I am wrong.  </p>

			<h3>Design a hashmap</h3>
			<h4>Posted on July 19th, 2017</h4> 
			<p> There are two ways: one uses separate chaining (linked lists), the other uses open addressing (arrays). See <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-3-open-addressing/">this article</a>. Btw, distinguish linear and quadratic open addressing. Also, search hashcode if you do not understand how it works. I think what you should know is how to dynamically increase and decrease the hashtable size (well, maybe decrease is kinda hard to implement). Java only has increase which is realized by using load factor (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html"> see Java Documentation</a>). The initial capacity should be increased as the number of elements are much more than the bucket size and decreased when it is far below. One specific question will be here: <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/">Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, search and getRandom in constant time</a>. I kind feel the solution provided there is cheating. Well, at least storing twice in hashtable and dictionary sounds a little silly to me. I feel one should at least understand how hashmap is implemented in Java or C++ built-in libraries. If one understands how it is actually implemented, then using another array to index it is quite uncessary. </p>

			<p> The reason why I want to mention <a href="https://www.viva64.com/en/a/0054/#ID0EM5CK">30 common OpenMP traps</a> is that due to one line in C++ legacy code which uses OpenMP '#pragma omp parallel for', I wasted quite a few days debugging my codes which turn out to be bug-free. What a lesson to remember. It is always easier to prevent this from the beginning compared to debugging in the hard way. In this case, it is espcially hard, since it is randomized algorithm, the bug is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">Heisenbug</a>. And due to the complexity of all the codes, me and my adviosr wasted days debugging it and it is really a painful memory. </p>

			<h3>Notes on C++</h3>
			<h4>Posted on July 5th, 2017</h4> 
			<p>I decide that next time I do an interview, I will ask the interviewer which language he wants me to use, C++ or Python. The main reason is that some people simply look down people who coded in Python and sometimes I find out interviewers are having a hard time understanding my Python codes (probably because Python is so flexible and can do many things in one line which C++/Java cannot possibly achieve). The benefits of using Python in text mining is enormous. Despite so, I find C++ to be more elegant. Oh, I like pointers and using them are great although the freedom sometimes comes with a price. It requires people who use it to know exactly what they are doing and have to be very very careful. Because sometimes bugs are hard to trace and compiler does little to help compared to the languages which use interpreter. After coding in C++ for the past July 4th holiday and last weekend, I find today's work coding in Python to be so much easier. Well, maybe because it is easier, I made a few stupid mistakes. I fixed a few run-time errors easily but logical errors are much harder to trace. Doing parallel computing in Python is also very painful. Sometimes I feel I have to do something stupid to get around some errors which probably won't even exisit in C++ or Julia.  </p>

			<h3>Column-Based DBMS</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 27, 2017</h4>
			<p>Tomorrow I need to extract data from another database called Vertica, which is different from the NoSQL I am using now.</p>
			<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS">wikipedia</a>, A column-oriented DBMS (or columnar database management system) is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data tables by column rather than by row. Practical use of a column store versus a row store differs little in the relational DBMS world. Both columnar and row databases can use traditional database query languages like SQL to load data and perform queries. Both row and columnar databases can become the backbone in a system to serve data for common extract, transform, load (ETL) and data visualization tools. However, by storing data in columns rather than rows, the database can more precisely access the data it needs to answer a query rather than scanning and discarding unwanted data in rows. Query performance is often increased as a result, particularly in very large data sets.</p>

			<p>To read more on Vertica, read the documentation <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/8.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/AnalyzingData/Queries/SQLQueries.htm%3FTocPath%3DAnalyzing%2520Data%7CQueries%7C_____3">here.</a></p>

			<h3>OpenStack Framework</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 26, 2017</h4>
			<p>Openstack is the framework that companies, including AT&T, use to build on top to have their own private cloud. Here is the slides I use to learn the basics: <a href="./materials/openstack.pdf">openstack 101</a> </p>

			<p>The following is taken from <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-OpenStack-different-from-Hadoop-and-Spark/answer/Bob-Marshall-14?srid=Jxy2">Quora.</a> </p>
			<p>OpenStack is a cloud computing platform. It provides infrastructure, essentially servers, from cloud-based resources. Hadoop and Spark are distributed data processing platforms which may be implemented in a local data center (on premise) or in the cloud.
<br><br>
OpenStack has a number of components that manage and serve the pieces of a cloud-based data center: Nova for compute, Neutron for networking, Cinder for block storage, Keystone for identity, Swift for object storage, etc.
<br><br>
Hadoop has components for operating a distributed compute service: the Hadoop File System (HDFS) for storing data in a replicated manner; YARN for distributed computing (including the MapReduce paradigm); Hive, Impala, SparkSQL, Presto, HAWQ (and others) for SQL on Hadoop; HBase for columnar data store; etc.
<br><br>
Spark also provides distributed compute, and has libraries for Machine Learning, Streaming, SQL, and others. Spark can sit atop Hadoop or other data stores, for example Cassandra.</p>

			<h3>Difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 25, 2017</h4>
			<p>The following answer is taken from  <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/index.htm">Quora</a> by Ewan Leith, which really helps me understand my role as intern a lot. </p>
			<p><b> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b><br>
Providing the fundamental building blocks of computing resources, IaaS takes the traditional physical computer hardware, such as servers, storage arrays, and networking, and lets you build virtual infrastructure that mimics these resources, but which can be created, reconfigured, resized, and removed within moments, as and when a task requires it. The most well known IaaS provider, Amazon Web Services, offers a variety of options, including their “EC2” computing platform, and “S3” storage platform.
<br><br><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b><br>
Operating at the layer above raw computing hardware, whether physical or virtual, PaaS provides a method for programming languages to interact with services like databases, web servers, and file storage, without having to deal with lower level requirements like how much space a database needs, whether the data must be protected by making a copy between 3 servers, or distributing the workload across servers that can be spread throughout the world. Typically, applications must be written for a specific PaaS offering to take full advantage of the service, and most platforms only support a limited set of programming languages. Often, PaaS providers also have a Software as a Service offering (see below), and the platform has been initially built to support that specific software. Some examples of PaaS solutions are the “Google App Engine” system, “Heroku” which operates on top of the Amazon Web Services IaaS system, and “Force.com” built as part of the SalesForce.com Software as a Service offering.
<br><br><b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b><br>
The top layer of cloud computing, Software as a Service is typically built on top of a Platform as a Service solution, whether that platform is publicly available or not, and provides software for end-users such as email, word processing, or a business CRM. Software as a Service is typically charged on a per-user and per-month basis, and companies have the flexibility to add or remove users at any time without addition costs beyond the monthly per-user fee. Some of the most well known SaaS solutions are Google Apps, Salesforce.com, and Microsoft Office 365</p>

			<h3>Use of VirtualBox and Ubunbu</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 22, 2017</h4>
			<p>
				The one thing that frustrates me most at the beginning few days at work is that I don't have access to do almost everything, and LITERALLY EVERYTHING. What makes it worse is that I am not even that familiar with how to use shell in Windows. I tried Putty at first. I thought Putty with sublime can do the job. To install those softwares, I have to request temporary admin rights even. However, it is still not very efficient to code in such environment. Finally, I realize one way to get around all of this which I have always hesitated to do on my mac is to install Ubunbu on virtual machine on top of the company computer (host machine). And VirtualBox is one way to do this. To know more, please Google. I had a lot of links on this including troubleshooting but those links are on company laptop. Just one thing to bear in mind: set up shared folder after installing guest additions to copy things between host machine and VM. One lesson I learnt is practice makes perfect. I am getting better at shortcuts every day because I need those, unlike on mac, I don't really need most of those. Oh, I miss trackpad SO MUCH !!!

			<h3>Summary of pass of arguments in function calls in Python, Java, C++</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 22, 2017</h4>
			<p>
				<b>For Java,</b> see <a href="http://jonskeet.uk/java/passing.html#formal">link</a>.
				To summarize: (make sure you understand what passing a reference by value actually means)
				<!-- <ol><li>Truth #1: Everything in Java is passed by value. Objects, however, are never passed at all.</li><li>Truth #2: The values of variables are always primitives or references, never objects.</li></ol>

				<pre><code class = java>
				Object x = null;
				giveMeAString (x);
				System.out.println (x);
				[...]

				void giveMeAString (Object y)
				{
				    y = "This is a string";
				}


				</pre></code>
				the result (if Java used pass-by-reference semantics) would be

				<b>This is a string</b>
				instead of the actual result:

				<b>null</b>. 
				Similarly for:
				<pre><code class = java>
				int x = 0;
				giveMeATen (x);
				System.out.println (x);
				[...]

				void giveMeATen (int y)
				{
				    y = 10;
				}
				</pre></code>
				You will have 0 instead of 10, which some may think. <br><br>
				The reason there is so much confusion is people tend to blur the distinction between an object reference variable and an object instance. All object instances in Java are allocated on the heap and can only be accessed through object references. So if I have the following:

				<pre><code class = java>StringBuffer g = new StringBuffer( "Hello" );</pre></code>
				The variable g does not contain the string "Hello", it contains a reference (or pointer) to an object instance that contains the string "Hello".
				So if I then call f( g ), f is free to modify its formal parameter s to make it point to another StringBuffer or to set it to null. The function f could also modify the StringBuffer by appending " World" for instance. While this changes the value of that StringBuffer, the value of that StringBuffer is NOT the value of the actual parameter g.

				Imagine for instance if I set g to null before passing it to f. There is no StringBuffer now to modify and f can in no way change the value of g to be non-null.

				The bottom line is Java only has variables that hold primitives or object references. Both are passed by value.
				The semantics of call by sharing differ from call by reference in that assignments to function arguments within the function aren't visible to the caller (unlike by reference semantics), so e.g. if a variable was passed, it is not possible to simulate an assignment on that variable in the caller's scope. However, since the function has access to the same object as the caller (no copy is made), mutations to those objects, if the objects are mutable, within the function are visible to the caller, which may appear to differ from call by value semantics. Mutations of a mutable object within the function are visible to the caller because the object is not copied or cloned — it is shared. <br> -->

				<b>Another explanation will be Java object references are also call by sharing:  </b>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_sharing">wiki page</a>. And for primitives, it is call by value. Personally, I feel this explanation makes more sense and it is consistent with the way Python is defined.
			</p> 		
			<p> <b>For C++,</b> see <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/references.html">Pass By Reference vs. Pass By Value</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cgs4406/notes/pointers.html">Pass By Address(Pointer)</a> Basically, pass by value won't affect the original arguments while pass by reference does. Pass By Address offers another method of allowing us to change the original argument of a function (like with Pass By Reference).  Don't pass in the argument itself -- just pass in its address.</p>
			<p> <b>For Python:</b> read <a href="http://www.python-course.eu/passing_arguments.php">call by sharing</a>. If you pass immutable arguments like integers, strings or tuples to a function, the passing acts like call-by-value. The object reference is passed to the function parameters. They can't be changed within the function, because they can't be changed at all, i.e. they are immutable. It's different, if we pass mutable arguments. They are also passed by object reference, but they can be changed in place in the function. If we pass a list to a function, we have to consider two cases: Elements of a list can be changed in place, i.e. the list will be changed even in the caller's scope. If a new list is assigned to the name, the old list will not be affected, i.e. the list in the caller's scope will remain untouched. </p>

			<p> <b>For Julia:</b> I think julia has the same property (call by sharing) as Python although doc says it is pass by reference but it is the same as Python. Please point it out if you find difference.</p>

            <h3>One article I found interesting </h3>
            <h4>Posted on Oct 05, 2017</h4>
            <p> <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-overview.htm">Article</a> talks about some facts on PhD program. I thoght it would be interesting to people to who want to pursue PhD in the future. I found what he said in the end to be quite interesting: </p>
             <p>   "The students who excel at playing the “Ph.D. game” are those who are able to figure out how to pursue research that they personally find interesting but that can also appeal to their advisors, grant agencies, and paper reviewers. I hesitate to give a single blanket definition of “success” for a Ph.D. student, but if I had to give one, I would define success as being able to pursue your own research interests as much as possible while still being able to convince the three to five professors on your thesis committee to let you graduate."</p>

			<p> I never realized that my birthday is so close to Uncle Sam's, well, probably because for past few years, I was never around at this time of the year in America. </p>

			<h3>Another lesson learnt</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 28, 2017</h4>
			<p> When you change variable names or doing optimization of codes, please do it one by one and make sure all the units pass before commiting the change. You will never what mistake you will make, even when you simply add one line to hundreds of lines of codes or change some variable name.</p>

			<h3>One lesson learnt</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 26, 2017</h4>
			<p>Between delivering results fast or writing qualify codes, which one should you choose?</p>
			<p>My understand is that first write code that works and get the initial results / get the job required by the boss done before spending tons of time optimizing codes. It is hard to use the optimal algorithm, carefully comment everything and make codes of good quality and fast. Of course, if you can do both at the same time, why not? The reality is that although I only wrote ~200 lines codes, it still could contain a lot of sutble bugs or corner cases hard to think of. If you spend days debugging and re-implementing working codes (which could be slow or use a lof of memory) in the smartest way, then you will suffer from the issues of not delivering fast. It will be not good to you if you have nothing to show your work to your boss. It is much better to show results first and then optimize the codes later, which you should do ASAP otherwise you will pay "interests" from the technical debts. </p>

			<h3>Difference between Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 24, 2017</h4>
			<p> The following is taken from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Data-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1">Quora</a></p>
			<p> Data engineers are hard core engineers who know the internals of database softwares. He compiles and installs database systems, writes complex queries, scales it to multiple machines, ensures backups and puts disaster recovery systems in place. He usually has a deep knowledge and expertise in one or more different database softwares (SQL / NoSQL). </p>
			<p>The primary tasks of a data analyst are compilation and analysis of numerical information. They usually have a computer science and business degree. They get analytical insights out of all the data which an organization can have (Database softwares or just excel sheets) which makes sense for the organization and compile them into decent reports so that other non technical folks can understand and decide their course of action. </p>
			<p>A "Data Scientist" usually has many overlapping skills - Database Engineering, handling BigData systems like Hadoop OR Netezza, knowledge of Python/R and knowledge of statistics / data mining.

			<h3>Someone's answer on Quora</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 22, 2017</h4>
			<p> See here: <a href="https://www.quora.com/If-almost-everyone-can-learn-programming-for-free-why-is-the-salary-very-high/answer/John-Byrd-2?srid=Jxy2">link</a>.

			What I like most is that: </p>
			<br>
			
			<h4>"It is impossible to be a good programmer unless you are very passionate about the craft. You have to take great joy in seeing your concepts and inventions come to life.<br>
		    <br>
			Most people don’t have the patience. They want results now now now. Code requires patience and passion.<br>
			<br>
			Learning to code well takes years. Maybe even decades.<br>
			<br>
			If someone is truly patient and passionate, they can become a world class programmer with just a few hundred bucks worth of books, and a cheap laptop.<br>
			<br>
			Hell, they might not even need the books, if they have a stable Internet connection.<br>
			<br>
			But most people try to do it for the money. All these people fail and go do something easier.<br>
			<br>
			When you are happy eating, sleeping, and breathing the process of learning to program, you have a chance at becoming a good programmer.<br>
			<br>
			And the money is a nice side effect.<br>
			<br>
			The really good, the really expensive, programmers don’t do it for the money.<br>
			<br>
			They do it because they don’t have a choice.<br>
			<br>
			They do it for the joy in it."

			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I cannot agree more. What I feel internship so great is that you get paid to learn different cool, new things that you didn't learn before. Well, in that sense, it is similar to doing a PhD. LOL. </p>

			<h3>First Day of intern</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 20, 2017</h4>
			<p> Second day of life as an intern: finally I gained access to server and a lot of other things (printers, VPN and so on) and I learnt one lesson: keep track of plans for each day (writing down in word doc is a good idea), otherwise it is easy to get lost when you have too many tasks and too many links to read and study. </p>

			<h3>First Day of intern</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 19, 2017</h4>
			<p> I started my first day as an intern. It is a complete different experience from doing a PhD. It is very tiring although I haven't really done anything except gaining access and finding a laptop and work station. One lesson learnt: wear more to work. It will be cold in the office despite it is over 100 outside. The other lesson learnt: 不要害羞呀（拜托），多独立一些，争取做好工作和生活的平衡. </p>

			<h3>First Day at San Ramon Valley</h3>
			<h4>Posted on Jun 18, 2017</h4>
			<p> Tomorrow will be my first to work ever (as an intern). I am quite excited/nervous. I don't quite know what to expect but I guess I will simply try my best. Moving from Davis to San Ramon is tiring. But the photos I took are so beautiful that it is totally worth it. The little girl at my host family asked her mom if I am a photographer. I was thinking at my heart: while I am not quite there yet, I will try to capture the beauty of life other people don't see. Finding beauty around myself is also one of my life goals. Sometimes I find the math so beautiful that I want to tell everyone in the world my thoughts. Most of things in life are connected. If one understands one aspect of life, one starts to see everyhing else also makes sense. Just like both research and photography, one find beatuy that others are too used to and simply blind to. Researcher points out the beatuy by publishing papers and photographer points out the beauty by shooting and posting photos. </p>
