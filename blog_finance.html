            <h3>Principles of Stock Investments </h3>
            <h4>Posted on May 13, 2018</h4>
            <p> There are quite a few lessons from my short trading experience. Any single one costs me a lot of money and deserves memorizing such that no single mistake will be made again ever. </p>
            <p> <b id="black">Don't play fire using leveraged etfs.</b> Playing with leveraged etfs are more likely cost you tons of money than win you money. Risks/Rewards ratios are simply ridiculous. Just think of people who lost 99% a day in using SVXY. I simply cannot believe even fund managers made mistakes in using this financial derivatives. Similarly holding TVIX is also equally terrible. It is like gambling.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col c6"><img src="images/svxy.png"  alt="" /></div>
            </div>

            <p><b id="black">Resist temptation for betting in earnings. </b> For those risky stocks that one does not intend to hold over long time, one should hedge the position by buying puts options. Even simply bet on day-to-day change is very risky: one never knows how much the pre-market or post-market price will differ from the real price movements in regular trading. I know how tempting betting on earnings report can be. But most of the time, it is a gambling game. It is much better to be reactive in this case rather than being proactive.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col c6"><img src="images/bbby.png" height = 250 alt="" /></div>
                <div class="col c6"><img src="images/snap.png"  height = 250 alt="" /></div>
            </div>

            <p><b id="black">Buy low and sell high. </b> I know this is easy to say but indeed it is probably the hardest thing to do. Everyone can hold the stock when it goes up but very hard to hold when going down, not even to mention to buy more at the dips. That is why the next principle is also extremely important.</p>

            <p><b id="black">Diversify by opening small positions in various stocks (or even assets). </b> I think that this is probably most important lesson in investors' history. How to control and manage risks? The power of compounding is simply amazing. If one can make 10% a year, that is pretty good already. 10% a month is like amazing. If one can have the same return 10% for 7 months, you can double your money. Or if you can do it for a year, you can get three times your original investments. Of course, it is hard, especially hard if you take very small risks by diversification. But although it is tempting to all in your money and double within a short period of time, it is much better off playing safe and make decent returns over time. Otherwise it is easy to blow up your account and lose your principal. This is called: money that comes easy also goes away fast. Diversifying is free lunch. So why not take it? </p>

            <p><b id="black">Use margin loans smartly. </b> Margin is never supposed to be used to make more profits on any single deal. Using margin that way will kill you. Also, a high interest rated margin provided by most brokers will likely kill you. The one reason that Buffet succeeded in early times is that he has access to cheap float money surronding his issurance companies for investments.</p>


            <p><b id="black">Importance of reading 10-K and 10-Q SEC Filings.</b> As an outsider, the only way to understand the true risks of businesses is to read those filings. U.S. companies are obliged to provide those numbers and those numbers are what we can trust. Not words from CEO or CFO, nor the price targets provided by analysts. Technical analysis is good in hindersight but most of time it is not useful enough for predicting the future. Those, like pivot study or RSI can definitely help you make deciions but in the end it is the fundamentals that matters most. Is the stock considered as value stock or growth stocks or momentum stock for speculations? How they compare with other peers in the same sectors in terms of different criteria: are they fairly valued, overvalued or undervalued? Those are very important for investors, even short-term investors. </p>

            <p><b id="black">Have a correct mindset.</b> Just think of every day as a new day. Do not avoid buying something simply because it has gone up so much in the past, like NVDA back in 2017. Similarly, do not buy sell simply because it looks so cheap! Price is relative to the value buried in the company. Don't regret the money that has not been made as there arise new opportunities every day. Tempory loss is fine as long as the fundalmentals have not changed. Patience is key here. I feel people have more patience when they don't put all eggs in one basket. </p>

            <p><b id="black">Event-driven speculation.</b> A sharp drop in stock price presents a buy opportunity many times. Or a continual drop of stock price for extended period for not very good reasons. For example, today Trump seems to exchange ZTE deal for interests for farmer goods and NXPI deal for QCOM. The stock price jumped from 90s to 110s, which means it is 20% return for very short period of time. I have been paying attention to getting in for some time but was feeling hesitated due to the risks associated it. </p>

            <h3>Several Trends Observed </h3>
            <h4>Posted on May 13, 2018</h4>
            <p> There are a few interesting trends I find turns out to hold for the past half year. Any single trend means sizable profit: 30% profit within a very short period of time. </p>
            <p> Oil remains strong and energy stocks rebouned after entering correction territory in Feb. </p>
            <div class="row">

                <div class="col c6"><img src="images/energy2.png"  alt="" /></div>
            </div>
            <p> Retail is not dead yet. Department stores like Macy (M) and apparel stocks like ANF, FOSL recovers from lowest points. </p>

            <p> 2018 will be a good year for movie related industry. It is not a surprise that Regal got acquired at lowest point. AMC seems fairly valued if not under valued. Rising box office in 2018 will likely help AMC with a higher earning. The only concern is the high debt it carries in the rising interest environment.</p>
